        I’m a back-end developer with a degree in Computer Science and strong
        experience building scalable APIs, microservices, and system
        integrations using technologies like C#, .NET, Docker, Redis, RabbitMQ,
        and both SQL and NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, RavenDB).
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-[var(--light-color)] leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I’ve worked on building service-oriented applications with features such
        as user registration and management, profiles, ratings, notifications
        (via Firebase Cloud Messaging), and flexible email delivery systems
        using various SMTP providers. I also contributed to codebase
        architecture improvements, simplifying shared resource integration
        across multiple applications and eliminating issues caused by symlinks.
        While my main focus is back-end, I’ve also contributed to the front-end
        side of projects using JavaScript, TypeScript, and Vue.js.

        I’m a proactive problem-solver, a clear communicator, and a team player
        who values clean, maintainable code and collaborative environments. I'm
        always learning and looking for new challenges that allow me to grow and
        deliver real impact through technology.
